They pass various celestial bodies and eventually reach the sun, which has a face and seems to swallow the ship. The explorers land and find the sun's surface to be a strange, fiery landscape. The heat becomes unbearable, forcing them to retreat into their ship's ice compartment. They then fall into a solar ocean, and eventually, their ship is shot out of a solar flare back to Earth, landing in the sea. They are rescued by sailors and return home to great acclaim.",
